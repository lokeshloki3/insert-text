   - The `<Document />` component contains:  
     - A **textarea** for user input.  
     - A **div** that acts as the document container where submitted text is displayed.

   - When the user presses **Enter** inside the textarea:  
     - The current text is **added to the document container**.  
     - The textarea is **cleared** automatically.

   - This blue highlight **fades away after 2 seconds**.
